# Patrick Navarre's "What I've Learned"            

## Markdown

I've learned that Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax that makes it easier to write for the internet/computer.

There are a few basic font changes that you can do.

1. If you want to make something italic you place a "*" on each side of the word. 

2. Placing 2 "*"s around a word will make it **bold** 

3. Placing 3 "*"s around the word will make it ***bold and italic*** 

Also if you want Markdown to create Bullet Points instead of a numbered list you can use * in replace of the numbers.  

* I also learned to post an image like this...

* or even a website link like this...

### In addition to all this sweet Markdown knowledge, I'm also starting to learn how to use Terminal.  

### I'm really looking forward to what's next!

# `and then in Week 1 is where things started to get interesting...`


# ...and complicated.

* We started learning how to collaborate with others and using Git and Github. Git is tool for developers to use to track changes in code during the software developement stage.

There are some steps in order to have the process work on Github.  

After completing whatever coding task that needed to be done you need to "push" the changes up to Github.  That will allow the others on the team to "pull" those changes into the parent code.  

The process is ADD / COMMIT / PUSH 

Once a task has been performed by a collaborater and that person wants to share the work with others you need to do the following:

1. git add fileName 
2. git commit - m "your message" 
3. git push 

Those steps would then send the changes to Github. 

The other collaboraters would then do a "git pull" to grab those changes that were made.

### In `week 1` we also started learning about `functions` and `variables` 

`function` is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action.

`variable` are data values that can change when the user is asked a question, for example, their age. Variables may change during program execution. A variable is a memory location . It has a name that is associated with that location. The memory location is used to hold data
